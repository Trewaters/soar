### "Pushing good code"

**Q:** **_"Am I pushing good code?"_**

_***Answer yes*** to the list below and you are pushing GREAT CODE!_

1. `npm run dev` and there aren't any errors in the server terminal or client (web browser) console.
2. `npm run build` no breaking build errors. Warnings are acceptable but should be minimized. Errors are not acceptable.
3. `npm run cover` to make sure no unit test are failing. Coverage goal is (A) 100%, (B) 90%, (C) 80%.
4. Push `develop` branch to hosting. Verify that the build was Successful and show **Ready** in vercel hosting. Then check how the app works on the web. Test with desktop and mobile device. Again checking the client (web browser) console for errors. "Click things and navigate around the app" especially any features your code touches.

## Developer Guide

### Prerequesites:

Node.js >=18, npm, MongoDB.

### Setup Instructions:

- Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/Trewaters/soar.git`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Set up a local MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas.
- Start the development server and local DB instance: `npm run concurrent`

Dev tip: sometimes I need to clear my npm cache so the library versions are installed correctly.

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

### MongoDB instructions

Install MongoD locally for development purposes. Use Cloud services for production.

install location:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"
```

```bash
mongod --version
```

_Start MongoDB locally_

1. Start app: `npm run dev`
2. Run with replica set in config: `mongod --config C:/data/config/mongod.conf`

_mongod.conf_

Example details for my current config file.

```
# mongod.conf

# Where and how to store data.
storage:
  dbPath: c:/data/db

# where to write logging data.
systemLog:
  destination: file
  path: C:/data/log/mongod.log

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1  # Listen to local interface only, comment to listen on all interfaces.

# processManagement options
processManagement:
  pidFilePath: C:/data/mongod.pid  # location of pidfile

# Replica Set Config
replication:
  replSetName: "rs0"
```

_Backup DB_

[MongoDump](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/) creates files that can be used to restore database with Mongorestore.

```
mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017" --out=C:/data/mongoDumpLocalhost

mongodump --uri="mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<YOUR.DETAILS.mongodb.net>/yogadb?replicaSet=<REPLICA_SET_ID>&retryWrites=true&w=majority" --out=C:/data/mongoDumpProduction
```

_Restore DB_

MongoRestore restores files created by mongoDump to a MongoDB instance. This command resotres from a directory to the local mongod instance.

```
mongorestore  C:/data/mongoDump/
```

_Export collection_

```
mongoexport --collection=<coll> <options> <connection-string> --jsonArray

mongoexport --collection=AsanaPosture mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox
```

```
mongoexport --collection=AsanaPosture mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_AsanaPosture.json

mongoexport --collection=AsanaSequence mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_AsanaSequence.json

mongoexport --collection=AsanaSeries mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_AsanaSeries.json

mongoexport --collection=ProviderAccount mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_ProviderAccount.json

mongoexport --collection=UserData mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_UserData.json

mongoexport --collection=accounts mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_accounts.json

mongoexport --collection=users mongodb://localhost:27017/yogaDBSandbox --out=C:/data/export/exported_users.json
```

### Tests

_Jest unit test_

- Jest for unit tests. Run: npm run test.
- End-to-end tests (WIP).

My current excuse is to wait until MVP before creating test around features.

_Running unit tests_

execute the unit tests via **Jest** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

_Running end-to-end tests_

execute the end-to-end tests via **?Test Kit** [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

Originally Found yoga poses [here](https://www.pocketyoga.com/pose/). Currently used for test data. Final version of the application will have user generated data for postures.

### Deployment

**Deployed on Vercel**

An easy way to deploy your Next.js app is with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Changelog

**Types of changes**

- `ADD`: for new features.
- `UPDATE`: for changes in existing functionality.
- `DEPRECATE`: for soon-to-be removed features.
- `REMOVE`: for now removed features.
- `FIX`: for any bug fixes.
- `SECURITY`: in case of vulnerabilities.
- `AUDIT`: code clean up. Carefully removing unnecessary files.

### Prisma Database

Start using Prisma Client in Node.js (See: https://pris.ly/d/client)

```js
import { PrismaClient } from './prisma/generated/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

or start using Prisma Client at the edge (See: https://pris.ly/d/accelerate)

```js
import { PrismaClient } from './prisma/generated/client/edge'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
npm exec prisma db push
```

This is failing for mongodb at the moment (2024-08-09 06:22:38)

```bash
npm exec prisma migrate dev
```

### Known Bugs

**TITLE (as of DATE)**

**Twitter Auth Forbidden (as of 2024-07-26 16:18:25)**

Currently setup to use v5 of Auth.js. Provider must be tested from Vercel hosting due to TwitterX terms of use. When trying to login through provider I get a 403 error in the browser. No errors showing in Vercel. Just has redirect log to Twitter auth.

What you are experiencing is a feature ðŸ˜‰ ! Open a [github issue](https://github.com/Trewaters/soar/issues) if you disagree.

## Branching Strategy

1. [`main`](https://soar-main.vercel.app/): production ready, mostly stable branch. Used for production deployment (publised to Vercel).
2. [`develop`](https://soar-develop.vercel.app/): active development, active work that is merged into main. Use this branch to check builds and pre-production deployment issues. Any work I started is a branch created from develop.
3. [`version_stable`](https://soar-jade.vercel.app/) - stable version this is the stable build of the most current version I am working on.
4. Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>` - features I work on that could go merge into develop when complete.
   `version_010` - release version 0.1.0.

### Current internal "feature" branches

I create branches with the name of the feature I plan to work on. This way I keep my work seperated. If I don't finish I can come back to it, but it won't interfere with any other work I want to do on the app. These have been created organically and are due to change without notice because I am currently working alone.

- _"feature/app-theme-and-style":_ Update the app theme and style. Use professional themes as influence. [Link to "Style Guide" page](http://localhost:3000/styleGuide)
- _"feature/flow":_ Flow portions of the app. Views (Practice view), edit, create Asanas, Series and Sequences.
- _"feature/auth":_ Develop authentication, user roles, general app security, etc.
- _"feature/nav":_ Application navigation elements
- _"feature/profile":_ Work on the yogi user profile. Allow view, edit and shareable link of profile data.
- _"feature/posture-cards":_ Work on asana features. Allow view, edit, and create postures.
- _"feature/core":_ Core work in the app like data connections, env variables, etc.

The "version" branches are locked after release.

I follow Semantic Versioning for releases. [Read more here](https://semver.org/) ...**[TLDR](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)**: _"A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0._

## Production Deployment Guide

### Environment Variables Setup

The application uses different database configurations for development and production. Both Prisma and the MongoDB client use a standardized `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with fallback support.

#### Development Environment

```bash
# Local MongoDB connection with replica set
DATABASE_URL='mongodb://localhost:27017/v2YogaDBSandbox?replicaSet=rs0'

# Legacy support (will be removed in future versions)
MONGODB_URI_v2='mongodb://localhost:27017/v2YogaDBSandbox?replicaSet=rs0'
```

#### Production Environment (Vercel)

Set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. **DATABASE_URL** (Primary)

   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/yogadb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

2. **MONGODB_URI** (Fallback for legacy support)
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/yogadb?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

#### Setting Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables for **Production** environment:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Same MongoDB Atlas connection string (for legacy support)
   - Any other required environment variables (NextAuth secrets, etc.)

### Database Migration and Setup

#### Local to Production Data Migration

**Warning**: Only migrate development data to production if it contains test data you want to preserve. For real production deployments, start with a clean database.

1. **Export local data** (if needed):

   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017/v2YogaDBSandbox" --out=./data/mongoDumpLocal
   ```

2. **Import to production** (if needed):
   ```bash
   mongorestore --uri="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/yogadb" ./data/mongoDumpLocal/v2YogaDBSandbox
   ```

#### Production Database Schema Setup

1. **Generate Prisma Client** for production:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Push schema** to production database:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. **Verify collections** exist in MongoDB Atlas:
   - `UserData`
   - `UserLogin`
   - `Account`
   - Other required collections per your schema

### Troubleshooting Production Issues

#### Login Activity Streak Not Working

If the Activity Streak feature fails in production:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:

   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel
   - Ensure the MongoDB connection string is valid
   - Check that the database name matches between local and production

2. **Database Connection Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Test connection string locally
   mongosh "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/yogadb"
   ```

3. **Missing Collections/Data**:

   - Check if `UserLogin` collection exists in production
   - Verify `UserData` collection has the required user records
   - Database names are case-sensitive: `yogadb` â‰  `YogaDB`

4. **API Endpoint Testing**:

   ```bash
   # Test the recordActivity API in production (automatically updates streak)
   curl -X POST "https://yourapp.vercel.app/api/user/recordActivity" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userId":"YOUR_USER_ID","activityType":"view_streaks"}'

   # Test the legacy loginStreak API in production (read-only)
   curl "https://yourapp.vercel.app/api/user/loginStreak?userId=YOUR_USER_ID"
   ```

5. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Functions tab
   - Check logs for database connection errors
   - Look for environment variable missing errors

#### Common Production Errors

1. **"Database configuration missing"**: Environment variables not set in Vercel
2. **"User not found"**: User doesn't exist in production database
3. **"Connection timeout"**: Invalid MongoDB connection string or network issues
4. **"Collection not found"**: Database schema not pushed to production

### Environment Variable Priority

The application checks environment variables in this order:

1. `DATABASE_URL` (preferred for all environments)

This ensures backward compatibility while moving toward a standardized approach.

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Set `MONGODB_URI` as fallback in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Configure NextAuth secrets (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`)
- [ ] Test database connection with production credentials
- [ ] Run `npx prisma generate` after any schema changes
- [ ] Verify all required collections exist in production database
- [ ] Test critical features (authentication, activity tracking) in staging
