# Series Access Control Security Update

## Overview

This update implements access control restrictions to ensure users can only view and interact with series that they created or that were created by designated "alpha users".

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route Updates

#### `/api/series` (GET) - Main Series Listing

- **Before**: Returned all series from database without access restrictions
- **After**:
  - Requires user authentication
  - Only returns series created by:
    - The current authenticated user
    - Alpha users (defined in `@app/lib/alphaUsers`)
  - Returns empty array for unauthenticated requests
  - Properly handles both direct calls and `createdBy` parameter filtering

#### `/api/series/[id]` - Individual Series Operations

- **Added GET method**: Fetches individual series with same access control rules
- **Updated PATCH method**: Now allows alpha users to edit any series (previously only creators)
- **Updated DELETE method**: Now allows alpha users to delete any series (previously only creators)

### 2. Access Control Logic

#### Authentication Requirements

- All series endpoints now require valid user authentication
- Unauthenticated requests receive empty responses or 401 errors

#### Permission Levels

1. **Regular Users**: Can only access series they created
2. **Alpha Users**: Can access and modify all series (their own + others)
3. **Series Creators**: Can access and modify their own series

#### Alpha Users Definition

- Alpha users are defined in `/app/lib/alphaUsers.ts`
- Currently includes: `['alpha@example.com']`
- Can be easily extended by modifying this file

### 3. Database Queries

- Updated Prisma queries to use `WHERE` clauses with `IN` operator
- Filters by `created_by` field against allowed user list
- Optimized to reduce database load by filtering at query level

### 4. Response Format

- Maintains existing API response format for backward compatibility
- Includes `createdBy` field for client-side ownership determination
- Preserves all existing fields and data structure

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Privacy**: Users can no longer see series created by other non-alpha users
2. **Access Control**: Proper permission checking at API level
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more alpha users or modify permission rules
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing client code continues to work

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- Application builds successfully
- No breaking changes to client-side code

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/series/route.ts` - Main series listing API
2. `/app/api/series/[id]/route.ts` - Individual series operations API

## Files Referenced

1. `/app/lib/alphaUsers.ts` - Alpha user definitions
2. Client components automatically benefit from restricted data

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding role-based permissions in database
2. May want to add audit logging for series access
3. Could implement more granular permission levels
4. Consider caching strategies for alpha user list

## Migration Notes

- No database schema changes required
- Existing series remain accessible to their creators
- Alpha users gain additional permissions immediately
- No data migration needed
