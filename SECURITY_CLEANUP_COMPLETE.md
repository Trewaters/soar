# Security Cleanup - API Keys Removed from Git History

## Issue

The commit accidentally included hardcoded Cloudflare API tokens and account IDs in debug files:

- `debug-cloudflare.js`
- `debug-cloudflare-2.js`

These files contained:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Two different API tokens were exposed
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Account ID was hardcoded

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Clean Branch**: Created `feature/core-clean` from the commit before the API keys were added
2. **Cherry-picked Changes**: Selectively copied all files from the problematic commit except the debug files with API keys
3. **Sanitized Debug Files**: Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variable references:

   ```javascript
   // Before (INSECURE)
   const CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN = ''
   const CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID = ''

   // After (SECURE)
   const CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN =
     process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN || 'YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE'
   const CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID =
     process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID || 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE'
   ```

4. **Rewrote Git History**:
   - Deleted the original `feature/core` branch
   - Renamed the clean branch to `feature/core`
   - Force-pushed to replace the remote history

## Current State

- ✅ **Git History Clean**: No API keys exist in the current commit history
- ✅ **Debug Files Sanitized**: All debug scripts now use environment variables
- ✅ **Remote Updated**: The remote repository has been updated with clean history
- ✅ **Functionality Preserved**: All the original functionality remains intact

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify no API keys in current commit
git show HEAD:debug-cloudflare.js | head -5

# Verify no API keys in git history
git log --all --full-history -- debug-cloudflare.js debug-cloudflare-2.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Rotate API Keys**: The exposed API tokens should be rotated/regenerated in Cloudflare dashboard
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure the actual API tokens in your local `.env` file:
   ```bash
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
   ```
3. **Verify .env in .gitignore**: Confirmed that `.env*` files are already in `.gitignore`

## Files Affected

- `debug-cloudflare.js` - Sanitized
- `debug-cloudflare-2.js` - Sanitized
- Git history completely rewritten for security

The repository is now secure and no longer contains any hardcoded API credentials.
