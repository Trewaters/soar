# Create Sequence Help

## Overview

The **Create Sequence** page allows you to build complete yoga practice sessions by combining multiple flow (flows) into an ordered sequence. Create structured sequences with intentional progression, add descriptions and images, and save custom practices for your yoga journey.

**Page URL:** `/flows/createSequence`

## What is a Sequence?

A **sequence** is an ordered collection of flow (flows) that creates a complete yoga practice session. While a flow focuses on a specific theme or body area, a sequence combines multiple flow into a structured practice journey.

**Examples of Sequences:**

- **Morning Flow**: Energizing sequence combining sun salutations, standing poses, and inversions
- **Evening Wind Down**: Calming sequence with gentle stretches, hip openers, and restorative poses
- **Full Practice**: Comprehensive sequence including warm-up, standing, seated, and closing flow
- **Quick Session**: 20-minute sequence combining 2-3 short flow for busy days
- **Themed Practice**: Sequences built around specific goals like "Back Pain Relief" or "Hip Flexibility"

## Tips for Creating Effective Sequences

**Sequence Naming:**

- Use duration in name for quick selection ("20-Min Core", "45-Min Full Body")
- Include focus area ("Back Pain Relief", "Hip Flexibility")
- Note difficulty level ("Beginner Gentle Flow", "Advanced Strength")
- Keep names concise but descriptive

**Building Balanced Sequences:**

- **Warm-up First** - Add gentle flow at beginning
- **Peak in Middle** - Place challenging flow in center
- **Cool Down Last** - Add restorative flow at end
- **Flow Smoothly** - Check pose transitions in preview
- **Duration Balance** - Mix short and long flow for variety

**Flow Selection Strategy:**

- Start with 2-3 flow for shorter sequences (20-30 minutes)
- Build 4-6 flow for full practice sessions (45-60 minutes)
- Mix flow focusing on different body areas
- Include both strength-building and flexibility flow
- Consider energy levels - energizing vs. calming

**Using the Pose Preview:**

- Navigate through all flow before saving
- Look for repetitive poses that might cause overuse
- Check for balanced body work (both sides, all areas)
- Note alignment cues to prepare for practice
- Verify smooth transitions between flow

**Description Best Practices:**

- State the sequence purpose clearly
- Include recommended skill level
- Note any props needed (blocks, straps, blankets)
- Mention specific benefits (stress relief, flexibility, strength)
- Add timing suggestions (morning, evening, pre-workout)

**Image Selection:**

- Choose images that match sequence energy
- Use personal photos from your practice for authenticity
- Landscape orientation displays better
- High quality images enhance visual appeal
- Consider theme or focus area representation

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a flow (flow) and a sequence?**

A: A **flow (flow)** is a collection of individual yoga poses grouped by theme or purpose. A **sequence** is a complete practice session made by combining multiple flow in a specific order. Think of flow as chapters and sequences as the complete book.

**Q: How many flow should I include in a sequence?**

A: It depends on your practice duration and goals. For a 20-30 minute practice, use 2-3 flow. For 45-60 minute sessions, include 4-6 flow. Quality matters more than quantity - choose flow that flow well together.

**Q: Can I add the same flow multiple times to a sequence?**

A: Yes! You can add any flow multiple times if you want to repeat it during practice. This is useful for creating balanced sequences (e.g., repeating a sun salutation flow between other flow).

**Q: Do I have to add flow in any specific order?**

A: No strict rules, but best practice is to order flow from gentle warm-up to peak intensity to cool-down. Use the pose preview feature to verify your sequence flows smoothly from beginning to end.

**Q: Can I reorder flow after adding them?**

A: Currently, flow are practiced in the order you add them. To change the order, remove flow and add them back in your preferred sequence. This is an intentional design to encourage thoughtful planning.

**Q: What happens if I click "Start Over" by accident?**

A: The "Start Over" button immediately clears all fields without confirmation. Your work is lost unless you've already saved. We recommend being careful with this button when you've invested time in building your sequence.

**Q: Can I edit a sequence after creating it?**

A: Yes! After creation, you'll be redirected to the sequence detail page where you can edit the name, description, image, and modify the flow list. Only the sequence owner can edit their sequences.

**Q: Why don't I see any flow in the search?**

A: If the search appears empty, you may not have created any flow yet. Start by creating some flows (flow) first at `/flows/createSeries`. You can also explore Alpha-curated flow if available in your account.

**Q: Is the description field required?**

A: No, the description is optional. However, adding a description helps you remember the sequence's purpose and makes it easier for others to understand if you share it. It's especially helpful months later when revisiting old sequences.

**Q: What's the best image size for sequence images?**

A: Images up to 5MB are supported in JPEG, PNG, or SVG formats. Landscape-oriented images (wider than tall) typically display better. Choose clear, high-quality images that represent your sequence's energy or theme.

**Q: Can I create sequences without being logged in?**

A: No, you must be logged in to create and save sequences. Sequences are saved to your personal account so you can access them across devices and sessions.

**Q: What happens to my sequence if I delete a flow that's in it?**

A: When you delete a flow from your library, sequences containing that flow may show the flow as "unavailable." It's best to edit sequences and remove references to flow before deleting them from your library.

**Q: How do I know if my sequence flows well?**

A: Use the poses preview feature to review how poses transition from one flow to the next. Navigate through each flow in your sequence and look for smooth progressions in intensity, logical body positioning, and balanced work across different body areas.
