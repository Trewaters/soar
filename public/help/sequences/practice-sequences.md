# Practice Sequences Help

## Overview

The **Practice Sequences** page allows you to explore and practice complete yoga sequences—structured flows that combine multiple series into a comprehensive practice session. Search for sequences, navigate through each series step-by-step, and track your practice progress over time.

**Page URL:** `/navigator/flows/practiceSequences`

## What is a Sequence?

A **sequence** is an ordered collection of yoga series that creates a complete practice journey. While a series focuses on a specific theme or body area, a sequence combines multiple series into a structured practice with beginning, middle, and end progression.

**Examples of Sequences:**

- **Morning Energizer** - Sun salutations, standing poses, and gentle backbends
- **Evening Wind Down** - Hip openers, twists, and restorative poses
- **Full Practice** - Comprehensive 60-minute session with warm-up, peak poses, and cool-down
- **Quick Flow** - 20-minute sequence for busy days
- **Therapeutic Sequence** - Targeted practice for specific needs (back care, stress relief)

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to practice the series in order?**

A: Yes, for best results. Sequences are designed with intentional progression for safety and effectiveness. However, you can use the pagination circles to jump to specific series if needed for review.

**Q: Can I save my progress and return later?**

A: The page doesn't save mid-sequence progress. When you return, you'll start from the beginning. However, you can use pagination circles to quickly jump to where you left off.

A: Go to Flows → Create Sequence. You'll be able to select multiple series and arrange them in your desired order with a description and image.

A: The page tries to load current series data. If a series no longer exists, it may show a warning or placeholder. Contact support if you encounter missing series in important sequences.

A: Use the search bar and view the "Mine" section to see your personal sequences. You can also browse through the autocomplete dropdown without typing.
