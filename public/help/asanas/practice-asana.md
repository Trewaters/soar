# Practice Asanas Help

## Overview

The **Practice Asanas** page helps you search, browse, and practice individual yoga poses (asanas). Use the search bar or filters to find poses, open a pose card to view details, and tap **Practice** to start guided practice for a specific pose.

**Page URL:** `/navigator/asanaPoses/practiceAsanas`

## What Is an Asana?

An **asana** is a single yoga posture. This page lists available asanas from your personal library and public/community collections so you can view details and practice individual poses.

**Examples:**

- "Warrior I" for a standing strength pose
- "Downward Dog" for full-body stretching
- A custom pose you create and save under **My Asanas**

## Page Components

### Search Bar

- Purpose: Find poses by name (English or partial keywords).
- Behavior: Starts showing results as you type; supports partial matches.

### Result Tabs / Filters

- **My Asanas**: Poses you created
- **Public Asanas**: Community-shared poses
- **Others**: All other poses

## Using Practice Asanas — Step-by-Step

1. **Open the page**: Navigate to `/navigator/asanaPoses/practiceAsanas`.

4. **Select a pose**: Tap the pose card to view details (images, cues, difficulty).
5. **Start practice**: Tap **Practice** on the card or detail view to begin a focused practice for that pose.
6. **Create a pose**: If you are signed in, use **Create** to add a custom pose (enter name, description, and optional image).

## Common Questions

**Q: Why don't I see the Create button?**

A: Creating poses requires an authenticated account. If you are not signed in you will see a prompt or freemium notification when attempting to create.

**Q: How do I add an image for a pose?**

A: When creating or editing a pose, use the image upload control. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG. Keep file sizes under 5 MB for best performance.

**Q: My new pose doesn't appear in search — why?**

A: The page may refresh when you return from the create flow. If it doesn't, try pulling down to refresh or navigating away and back. Also check the selected tab (My Asanas).
