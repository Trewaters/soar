# Practice Asanas Help

## Overview

The **Practice Asanas** page helps you search, browse, and practice individual yoga poses (asanas). Use the search bar or filters to find poses, open a pose card to view details, and mark activity for a specific pose.

## What Is an Asana?

An **asana** is a single yoga pose. This page lists available asanas from your personal library and public collections so you can view details and practice individual poses.

## Page Components

### Search Bar

- Purpose: Find poses by name (English or partial keywords).
- Behavior: Starts showing results as you type; supports partial matches.

### Result Tabs / Filters

- **My Asanas**: Poses you created
- **Public Asanas**: Community-shared poses
- **Others**: All other poses

## Using Practice Asanas — Step-by-Step

1. **Open the page**
2. **Search**: Type an English name (or part of it) in the search bar — results update as you type.
3. **Filter**: Use the grouped results (My Asanas / Public Asanas / Others) to narrow search.
4. **Select a pose**: Tap the pose name to view details.
5. **Start practice**: Mark activity in the detail view to begin a focused practice for that pose.
6. **Create a pose**: If you are signed in, use **Create** to add a custom pose (enter name, description, and optional image).

## Tips for Effective Use
