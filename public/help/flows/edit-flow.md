# Edit Flow Help

## Overview

The **Edit Flow** page allows you to modify existing yoga flow sequences by updating the flow name, adding or removing asanas, reordering poses, customizing alignment cues, managing images, and changing the flow description. Edit your flows to refine your practice sequences as your yoga journey evolves.

**Page URL:** `/navigator/flows/practiceSeries?id={flowId}` (Edit mode accessed via the Edit icon)

## What Can You Edit?

When you own a flow (or have admin permissions), you can modify:

- **Flow Name** - Change the title and identifier
- **Flow Description** - Update practice notes and purpose
- **Difficulty Level** - Adjust beginner/intermediate/advanced classification
- **Asana List** - Add, remove, or reorder poses in the sequence
- **Alignment Cues** - Add detailed instructions for each pose (up to 1000 characters)
- **Flow Images** - Upload, replace, or remove visual references

**Note:** You can only edit flows that you created or flows you have admin permissions for. The edit button (pencil icon) will only appear if you have edit access.

## Tips for Effective Flow Editing

**Keep Evolution in Mind:**

- Your practice evolves - update flows to match your current level
- Add new poses you've learned recently
- Remove poses that no longer serve your practice

**Maintain Flow Continuity:**

- Ensure pose transitions are smooth and logical
- Start with warm-up poses, progress to peak poses, end with cool-down
- Reorder as needed to maintain natural flow progression

**Use Alignment Cues Wisely:**

- Add cues for challenging poses or personal reminders
- Keep language clear and actionable
- Focus on what helps YOUR practice (not generic instructions)

**Update Difficulty Levels:**

- As you progress, some flows become easier
- Reclassify difficulty to match current challenge level
- Create new variations for different skill levels

**Manage Images Thoughtfully:**

- Use images that inspire and represent the flow essence
- Update images seasonally or when flow purpose changes
- Remove outdated or irrelevant images

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I edit flows created by others?**

A: No, you can only edit flows you created yourself or flows where you have admin permissions. The Edit button only appears for flows you own.

**Q: What happens to my practice history if I edit a flow?**

A: Your practice activity tracking remains intact. Edits to the flow don't affect your historical practice records.

**Q: Can I undo changes after saving?**

A: No, once you click "Save Changes" the modifications are permanent. The Cancel button must be used BEFORE saving if you want to discard changes.

**Q: What happens if I delete a flow I've been practicing?**

A: The flow and all its data are permanently removed. Your practice activity history for that flow is also deleted. This action cannot be undone.

**Q: Can I duplicate a flow instead of editing it?**

A: Currently there's no duplicate feature. To create a variation, use "Create Flow" and manually add the same poses with modifications.

**Q: How many poses should a flow contain?**

A: There's no strict limit, but 5-12 poses work well for most flows. Very short flows (2-3 poses) may feel incomplete, while very long flows (15+) can become unwieldy.

**Q: Do alignment cues appear during practice?**

A: Yes, alignment cues you add for each pose will display when practicing the flow, helping you maintain proper form and focus.

**Q: Can I change the flow creator/owner?**

A: No, the "Created By" field is read-only and cannot be changed. Ownership remains with the original creator.

## Editing Best Practices

**Before Making Major Changes:**

- Consider creating a new flow variation instead
- Note what's working in the current flow
- Have a clear reason for each modification

**When Adding Poses:**

- Ensure new poses fit the flow's theme/purpose
- Consider difficulty progression
- Place new poses in logical sequence positions

**When Removing Poses:**

- Verify the remaining sequence still flows well
- Don't remove poses that serve as bridges between others
- Maintain balance in body parts and pose types

**Alignment Cues Guidelines:**

- Write cues as if teaching yourself
- Focus on your personal alignment challenges
- Include breath reminders where helpful
- Keep under 1000 characters per pose

**Image Management:**

- Upload high-quality, relevant images
- Remove images that no longer represent the flow
- Consider seasonal updates for inspiration

Editing flows is a natural part of your yoga practice evolution. Don't hesitate to refine and improve your flows as your understanding deepens and your practice grows!
