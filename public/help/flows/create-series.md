# Create Series Help

## What is a Series?

A **Series** is a curated collection of yoga poses (asanas) grouped together by theme, focus area, or purpose. Series help you organize your yoga practice by creating meaningful groupings of poses that work well together.

**Examples of Series:**

- Morning Energy Flow - poses to energize and awaken
- Hip Openers - poses focused on hip flexibility
- Core Strengthening - poses that build core stability
- Backbend Preparation - poses that prepare for deep backbends
- Restorative Evening - gentle poses for relaxation

## How to Create a Series

### 1. Name Your Series

Choose a descriptive name that clearly indicates the purpose or theme of your series. Good names make it easy to find and use your series later.

### 2. Add a Description

Provide context about:

- The purpose of this series
- Who it's designed for (beginners, intermediate, advanced)
- Any specific benefits or goals
- When to practice this series (morning, evening, pre/post-workout)

### 3. Select Duration

Estimate how long it takes to practice all poses in this series. This helps you plan your practice sessions effectively.

### 4. Add Poses to Your Series

**Search and Select:**

- Use the search bar to find poses by name
- Browse through your available poses
- Select poses that align with your series theme

**Order Matters:**

- Arrange poses in a logical sequence
- Consider warm-up to peak to cool-down flow
- Think about transitions between poses

**Building a Balanced Series:**

- Include a variety of pose types
- Balance strength and flexibility
- Consider left/right side symmetry
- Include appropriate rest poses

### 5. Add an Image (Optional)

Upload an image that represents your series. This makes your series more visually appealing and easier to identify.

## Tips for Creating Effective Series

**Keep It Focused:**

- Stick to one theme or purpose per series
- Typically 5-12 poses work well for most series
- Too many poses can make a series unwieldy

**Consider Your Audience:**

- Label difficulty level clearly in the description
- Group poses by similar skill requirements
- Include modifications for different levels

**Think About Flow:**

- Start with gentle warm-up poses
- Progress to more challenging poses
- End with calming or restorative poses

**Use Clear Naming:**

- Avoid vague names like "Series 1"
- Be specific: "Shoulder Opening Sequence" vs "Upper Body Series"
- Include difficulty level if relevant: "Beginner Sun Salutation"

**Test Your Series:**

- Practice your series before finalizing
- Adjust pose order based on how it feels
- Remove poses that don't fit the flow

## Editing vs. Creating

**Create a New Series When:**

- You have a new theme or focus area
- You want to experiment with different poses
- You're building variations for different skill levels

**Edit an Existing Series When:**

- You want to refine the pose sequence
- You need to update the description or duration
- You want to add or remove a few poses

## Common Questions

**How many poses should a series have?**
There's no strict rule, but 6-10 poses is a good range for most series. Shorter series (3-5 poses) work for quick practices, while longer series (12-15 poses) can create full practice sessions.

**Can I use the same pose in multiple series?**
Yes! Poses can appear in as many series as you like. For example, Downward Dog might appear in your "Morning Flow," "Core Series," and "Arm Strength" series.

**What's the difference between a series and a sequence?**
A **series** is a collection of poses grouped by theme. A **sequence** is a structured practice that combines multiple series in a specific order with timing and instructions.

**Can I share my series with others?**
Currently, series are personal to your account. Future updates may include sharing capabilities.
