## Tips for Creating Effective Flow

**Keep It Focused:**

- Stick to one theme or purpose per series
- Typically 5-12 poses work well for most series
- Too many poses can make a series unwieldy

**Consider Your Audience:**

- Label difficulty level clearly in the description
- Group poses by similar skill requirements
- Include modifications for different levels

**Think About Flow:**

- Start with gentle warm-up poses
- Progress to more challenging poses
- End with calming or restorative poses

**Use Clear Naming:**

- Avoid vague names like "Flow 1"
- Be specific: "Shoulder Opening Sequence" vs "Upper Body Flow"
- Include difficulty level if relevant: "Beginner Sun Salutation"

**Test Your Flow:**

- Practice your series before finalizing
- Adjust pose order based on how it feels
- Remove poses that don't fit the flow

## Editing vs. Creating

**Create a New Flow When:**

- You have a new theme or focus area
- You want to experiment with different poses
- You're building variations for different skill levels

**Edit an Existing Flow When:**

- You want to refine the pose sequence
- You need to update the description or duration
- You want to add or remove a few poses

## Common Questions

**How many poses should a series have?**
There's no strict rule, but 6-10 poses is a good range for most series. Shorter series (3-5 poses) work for quick practices, while longer series (12-15 poses) can create full practice sessions.

**Can I use the same pose in multiple series?**
Yes! Poses can appear in as many series as you like. For example, Downward Dog might appear in your "Morning Flow," "Core Series," and "Arm Strength" series.

**What's the difference between a series and a sequence?**
A **series** is a collection of poses grouped by theme. A **sequence** is a structured practice that combines multiple series in a specific order with timing and instructions.

**Can I share my series with others?**
Currently, series are personal to your account. Future updates may include sharing capabilities.
