# Create Sequences Help

## What is a Sequence?

A **sequence** is an ordered collection of series (flows) that creates a complete yoga practice session. While a series focuses on a specific theme or body area, a sequence combines multiple series into a structured practice journey.

**Examples of Sequences:**

- **Morning Flow**: Energizing sequence combining sun salutations, standing poses, and inversions
- **Evening Wind Down**: Calming sequence with gentle stretches, hip openers, and restorative poses
- **Full Practice**: Comprehensive sequence including warm-up, standing, seated, and closing series
- **Quick Session**: 20-minute sequence combining 2-3 short series for busy days
- **Themed Practice**: Sequences built around specific goals like "Back Pain Relief" or "Hip Flexibility"

## How to Create a Sequence

### Step 1: Name Your Sequence

Enter a descriptive, memorable name for your sequence in the **Sequence Name** field. This is required.

**Tips:**

- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the purpose or duration
- Examples: "30-Minute Morning Practice", "Gentle Evening Flow", "Full Body Strength"
- A green checkmark appears when you've entered a name

### Step 2: Add Series to Your Sequence

Use the search field to find and add series (flows) to your sequence:

1. **Search for Series**: Type in the search box to find series by name
2. **Select a Series**: Click on a series from the dropdown to add it
3. **Build Your Flow**: Add multiple series in the order you want to practice them
4. **Review Order**: Series are numbered in the order they'll be practiced

**Tips:**

- Start with a warm-up series, progress to peak intensity, then cool down
- Mix different themes (standing, seated, twists, backbends) for variety
- Consider total duration when combining series
- You can preview each series' poses before adding

### Step 3: Preview Series Poses

Once you've added series, the **Poses Preview** section shows all poses in each series:

- **View Poses**: See the complete list of poses for each series
- **Navigate Series**: Use arrow buttons to preview different series if you added multiple
- **Check Flow**: Ensure the poses flow well from one series to the next
- **Verify Alignment**: Review alignment cues and Sanskrit names

### Step 4: Add a Description (Optional)

Use the **Description** field to add context about your sequence:

**What to Include:**

- Purpose or goal of the sequence
- Who it's designed for (beginners, intermediate, etc.)
- Special focus areas (flexibility, strength, relaxation)
- When to practice (morning, evening, post-workout)
- Any modifications or variations

**Example Description:**

> "A balanced 45-minute morning practice designed for intermediate practitioners. Focuses on building strength and flexibility through standing poses, hip openers, and gentle backbends. Perfect for starting your day with energy and focus."

### Step 5: Add an Image (Optional)

Upload an image to visually represent your sequence:

1. **Choose Image**: Click the upload area or drag and drop an image
2. **Preview**: See how your image looks
3. **Replace**: Upload a different image if needed
4. **Remove**: Delete the image if you change your mind

**Image Tips:**

- Use images that represent the sequence's theme or energy
- Landscape orientation works best for display
- Clear, high-quality images create better visual appeal

### Step 6: Submit Your Sequence

Once you're satisfied with your sequence:

1. **Review**: Check that all required fields are complete
2. **Submit**: Click the blue "Submit" button to save
3. **Practice**: Your sequence is now available in the Practice Sequences section

## Managing Your Sequences

### Reordering Series

To change the order of series in your sequence:

1. Remove the series you want to reposition (click the delete icon)
2. Re-add it in the desired position by searching and selecting it again
3. The series will be added at the end of your current list

### Removing Series

Click the **delete icon** (trash can) next to any series to remove it from your sequence.

### Starting Over

Click the **"Start Over"** button to clear all fields and begin creating a new sequence from scratch.

## Sequences vs. Series

**Understanding the Difference:**

| **Series (Flow)**              | **Sequence**                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Collection of individual poses | Collection of series         |
| Focuses on one theme/area      | Combines multiple themes     |
| Usually 10-30 minutes          | Can be any duration          |
| Building block                 | Complete practice            |
| Example: "Sun Salutation A"    | Example: "Morning Energizer" |

**Think of it this way:**

- **Poses** are individual yoga postures
- **Series** group poses into themed flows
- **Sequences** combine series into complete practices

## Tips for Creating Effective Sequences

### Flow and Progression

- **Warm-Up First**: Start with gentler series to prepare the body
- **Build Intensity**: Progress to more challenging series in the middle
- **Cool Down**: End with calming or restorative series
- **Logical Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions between series

### Duration Planning

- **Short Sequences (15-20 min)**: 2-3 concise series
- **Medium Sequences (30-45 min)**: 3-5 varied series
- **Long Sequences (60+ min)**: 5-8 series with full progression

### Balance and Variety

- **Body Balance**: Include series for different body areas
- **Energy Balance**: Mix activating and calming elements
- **Skill Balance**: Vary difficulty levels within the sequence
- **Theme Consistency**: Maintain a cohesive focus or intention

### Naming Best Practices

- Be specific about duration or intensity
- Indicate the time of day or purpose
- Use descriptive language that attracts practice
- Keep names concise but informative

## Common Questions

**Q: How many series should I include in a sequence?**  
A: It depends on your practice duration. Aim for 2-3 series for short sessions, 3-5 for medium sessions, and 5-8 for longer practices.

**Q: Can I use the same series multiple times in one sequence?**  
A: Yes! You might repeat a series like "Sun Salutation A" at the beginning and end, or practice the same series on both left and right sides.

**Q: What if I don't have enough series to create a sequence?**  
A: Start by creating more series first. A good sequence needs at least 2-3 series to be meaningful. Visit the "Create Series" page to build more flows.

**Q: Can I edit a sequence after creating it?**  
A: Currently, you'll need to create a new sequence with your changes. Make sure everything is correct before submitting.

**Q: How do I know my sequence flows well?**  
A: Use the poses preview to review how poses transition from one series to the next. Look for smooth progressions in intensity and logical body positioning.

**Q: Should my sequence have a specific focus?**  
A: It can! Some sequences focus on one goal (flexibility, strength, relaxation), while others are balanced full practices. Both approaches work well.

**Q: Can I share my sequences with others?**  
A: Sequences you create are currently visible to you and administrator users. Sharing features may be expanded in future updates.
