# ✅ Image Gallery Display Issue - RESOLVED!

## 🎯 Issue Summary

Images were failing to display in gallery cards, showing only placeholders despite no console errors being reported.

## 🔍 Root Cause

**CardMedia Component Prop Mismatch**: The `CardMedia` component in `EnhancedImageGallery.tsx` was configured with `component="img"` but using the `image` prop instead of the `src` prop.

When using `CardMedia` with `component="img"`, Material-UI expects the `src` prop to provide the image URL, not the `image` prop. The `image` prop is used when CardMedia acts as a background image container.

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### Fixed in `EnhancedImageGallery.tsx`:

```tsx
// BEFORE (incorrect)
<CardMedia
  component="img"
  image={displayUrl}  // ❌ Wrong prop for component="img"
  alt={image.altText || 'Yoga pose'}
/>

// AFTER (correct)
<CardMedia
  component="img"
  src={displayUrl}    // ✅ Correct prop for component="img"
  alt={image.altText || 'Yoga pose'}
  sx={{ objectFit: 'cover' }}  // ✅ Added for better scaling
/>
```

## 🎉 Results

- ✅ Images now display correctly in gallery cards
- ✅ Both cloud and local images render properly
- ✅ Maintains all defensive checks and fallbacks
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Proper image scaling with `objectFit: cover`

## 🧪 Testing Verified

- Gallery displays actual images instead of placeholders
- Both cloud (Cloudflare) and local (IndexedDB) images work
- Debug logging shows valid displayUrl values
- No CardMedia or Image component errors in console
- Fallback system still works for invalid/missing images

## 📊 Impact

This was the primary cause of the gallery display issue. The two different image save options (cloud and local) were being handled correctly in the logic, but the UI component wasn't displaying them due to the prop mismatch.
